                    <p>blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks, but not in the traditional sense of those words. When we say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”).</p>

                    <h1>What is Bitcoin?</h1>
                    <p>Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.</p>

                    <p> ETH is digital money. If you’ve heard of Bitcoin, ETH has many of the same features. It is purely digital, and can be sent to anyone anywhere in the world instantly. The supply of ETH isn’t controlled by any government or company - it is decentralized, and it is scarce. People all over the world use ETH to make payments, as a store of value, or as collateral.</p>

                <h1>How does Bitcoin work?</h1>
                <p>Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer.<br><br>

                    People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people.<br><br>

                    Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain.<br><br>

                    This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undo-ing transactions.<br><br></p>

                <h1>how does blockchain work?</h1>
                <p>Picture a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers. Then imagine that this network is designed to regularly update this spreadsheet and you have a basic understanding of the blockchain.

                Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared — and continually reconciled — database. This is a way of using the network that has obvious benefits. The blockchain database isn’t stored in any single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public and easily verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for a hacker to corrupt. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet.

                To go in deeper with the Google spreadsheet analogy, I would like you to read this piece from a blockchain specialist.</p>

                <h1>mining</h1>
                <p>There are three primary ways of obtaining Bitcoins: buying them on an exchange, accepting them for goods and services and mining new ones. Mining is a process of adding transaction records to the Bitcoin’s public ledger called the Blockchain. It exists so that every transaction can be confirmed, and every single user of the network can access this ledger. It is also used to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts of re-spending money that has already been spent somewhere else.</p>

                <h1>Etherium</h1>
                <p>Based on blockchain technology, etherium consist of series of cryptography or secure, public records linked together that each are difficult to change because they are stamped with user data, time and date and changes that must be approved by all users.

            On the ledger, anyone can create a financial contract or keep debt or ownership registries and eliminate the use of an external recordkeeper or trust officer. They're called "trustless" transactions because they eliminate the need for trusting the counterparty to the transaction since the contract is self-fulfilling.

            Because of its sweeping size and scope, ethereum's main technical problem has been speed and storage. It has operated at only a few transactions per second, with other crytpo platforms able to carry out hundreds. Users have complained of bottlenecks and the expense of using the platform.</p>
